# FABRIC Documentation

Private repository for tracking internal FABRIC documents


## How to contribute

Generally you'll be able to add/edit documents directly in Github without having to clone the repository. 

- Find the section from the **Table of Contents** that matches your content and contribute:
	- Add new document(s) in [Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) format
	- Edit an existing document
- Provide support files, references, excerpts of emails or conversations, anything that could add value by content or context to the project.
- Make use of the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/RENCI-NRIG/FABRIC-Private/issues) and [Milestones](https://github.com/RENCI-NRIG/FABRIC-Private/milestones) in any way that can assist you in keeping track of your information.
